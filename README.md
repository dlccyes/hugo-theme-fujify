# Fujify

Forked from https://github.com/dsrkafuu/hugo-theme-fuji, but added many quality of life improvements. It is used in my [personal blog](https://blog.derricklin.net/).

## How to use this theme in your Hugo project

First, clone it

```
git clone https://github.com/dlccyes/hugo-theme-fujify themes/fujify
```

Next, you can either add the repo as a submodule

```
git submodule add https://github.com/dlccyes/hugo-theme-fujify themes/fujify
```

Or you just remove `.git` to track all the files in this theme in your own git repo.

```
rm -r themes/fujify/.git
```
